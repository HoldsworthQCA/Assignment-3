This project is relevant to mine as I want to modify a toy like they have done and turn into something creepy. They have twisted a child’s toy icon into a weird uncanny valley spiderlike creature. They have also added servos to the eyes so they follower where the robot is looking making it somewhat life like.

Sophia the robot is relevant to my project as she is the cutting edge on AI technology and voice synthesis. Personally, I find her creepy as she falls into the uncanny valley. Her speech is just off enough that it almost sounds human, but it is still robotic. Also, her face is incredibly in the uncanny valley. I wish to implement voice synthases into this haunted doll to create integration between doll and person.

Charlie, Furby Mod

Charlie relates to my project as he is a horrifying Furby mod. They light up from inside the mouth. He screams horrifically and overall is incredibly unsettling and I hope to make something even close to the level of weirdness as them. I honestly could write a lot about how inspired I get from the Furby modding community however most of them don’t have a lot of circuity added onto them.

Neopixel Upgrade: Halo Energry Sword

The project was relevant to me as it shows how you can use neopixels to upgrade something that already has lights in it. It was interesting to watch the breakdown of the project from how you should test pre-existing electronics to make sure you don’t fry anything you add. I was also interesting to be introduced to a small microcontroller that works for neopixels. I may not use neopixels however I do want to add at least some LED element to the doll.

FLAP CHILD

I saw this sculpture last year and I haven’t been able to get it out of my head. These sculptures inspire me heavily. I love how horrible and fleshy it is. The weird way they move. The low fi speaker. However even though I love them I cant replicate them so I merely have to draw inspiration for thier bizarreness.

ALEXA Smart Mirror (New Build)

This was a relevant build to this project as it went though each DIY step on integrating smart technology into a mirror. It was interesting to see how the Hodge podded to the mirror together to create a smooth piece of technology. The interactions between preexisting tech into a new form is rather interesting and relevant as I need to think of how I don’t have to reinvent the wheel to create something interesting and unique. 
This project is related to mine because *insert reasons here*.


## Other research ##
The uncanny valley is where the human like elements of an object relates to how we relate to something. Once we reach a point in likeness humans find objects uncanny and unsettling. Things such a robots, dead bodies and certain children’s toys. Once something becomes to human, we become horrified of it. The whole project is based around this premise.

<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
