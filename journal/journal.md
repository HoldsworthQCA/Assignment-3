This project is relevant to mine as I want to modify a toy like they have done and turn into something creepy. They have twisted a child’s toy icon into a weird uncanny valley spiderlike creature. They have also added servos to the eyes so they follower where the robot is looking making it somewhat life like.

Sophia the robot is relevant to my project as she is the cutting edge on AI technology and voice synthesis. Personally, I find her creepy as she falls into the uncanny valley. Her speech is just off enough that it almost sounds human, but it is still robotic. Also, her face is incredibly in the uncanny valley. I wish to implement voice synthases into this haunted doll to create integration between doll and person.

Charlie, Furby Mod

Charlie relates to my project as he is a horrifying Furby mod. They light up from inside the mouth. He screams horrifically and overall is incredibly unsettling and I hope to make something even close to the level of weirdness as them. I honestly could write a lot about how inspired I get from the Furby modding community however most of them don’t have a lot of circuity added onto them.

Neopixel Upgrade: Halo Energry Sword

The project was relevant to me as it shows how you can use neopixels to upgrade something that already has lights in it. It was interesting to watch the breakdown of the project from how you should test pre-existing electronics to make sure you don’t fry anything you add. I was also interesting to be introduced to a small microcontroller that works for neopixels. I may not use neopixels however I do want to add at least some LED element to the doll.

FLAP CHILD

I saw this sculpture last year and I haven’t been able to get it out of my head. These sculptures inspire me heavily. I love how horrible and fleshy it is. The weird way they move. The low fi speaker. However even though I love them I cant replicate them so I merely have to draw inspiration for thier bizarreness.

ALEXA Smart Mirror (New Build)

This was a relevant build to this project as it went though each DIY step on integrating smart technology into a mirror. It was interesting to see how the Hodge podded to the mirror together to create a smooth piece of technology. The interactions between preexisting tech into a new form is rather interesting and relevant as I need to think of how I don’t have to reinvent the wheel to create something interesting and unique. 
This project is related to mine because *insert reasons here*.


## Other research ##
The uncanny valley is where the human like elements of an object relates to how we relate to something. Once we reach a point in likeness humans find objects uncanny and unsettling. Things such a robots, dead bodies and certain children’s toys. Once something becomes to human, we become horrified of it. The whole project is based around this premise.

Robert the doll is reportedly one of the most haunted dolls in the world. It is reported that is was a one of a kind creation of the Germany company Steiff Company at the turn of the century. Robert was lifelong companion of Eugene Otto. Eugene would often shift blame for any actions seen as misbehaving to Robert. After the death of Eugene, the new tenants of his family home would often hear strange noises and movement within the house.  Robert has also been blamed for camera malfunction, lights flickering and general torment to those who visit him. “INSIDE ROBERT THE DOLL...” ROBERT THE DOLL. Accessed May 10, 2020. http://robertthedoll.org/.
Robert the doll may or may not be haunted however he is unnerving. Even if it is the power of thought people place onto him. It could also be due to the fact he looks rather unsettling to modern standards of doll and his portions are very long and gangly compared to most modern dolls. He is apart of the reason I wanted to create a haunted doll for this project. To create a ‘real’ haunted doll when you touch it. To impart something unsettling on the audience. 

The other influence on the overall design aesthetics of the doll is the baby antichrist and demonic possession. The devil is the spawn point for most of the Christians greatest fear throughout history. This ranges from the fear of witches, demon possessions and satanic cults. These fears have spread across the western world as earlier as the fourteenth century. The demonic possession is the fear that a body will be corrupted by the devil (Levack, Brian P.). This idea of the devil corrupting is very frightening, this even more so if it is the thing in society, we cherish most a newborn baby. Therefore, I have corrupted the doll into a demon. It however is not fully demonic still harkening back to the fact it is still a baby doll at its core.

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
The intent of this work is the create an unsettling doll.

### Design ideation ###

### Design concept 1 ###
A soft sculpture that barley moves and lights up in different ways. It would also mimic the looks of animals however it would be spliced with multiple creates like a chimera from hell.

### Design concept 2 ###
A satanic bleeding goat doll. The idea is to modify a sheep doll to become a satanic toy. With a pentagram on its for head and blood dripping from its eyes. This would be made with a fluid pump pumping fluid out of eye holes. Also, it could have red glowing eyes. It would also have AI synthesised bleets and it would chant hymens robotically. 

### Final design concept ###
The main idea I have chosen to go with is a modified baby doll. This doll with speak when it can hear people are around. Once picked up it will vibrate in the persons hand. I want to incorporate some form of lighting, but I am currently unsure how. It will also have elements of its from changed such as one of its legs being elongated to create something even more unsettling. 

### Final design concept ###
The concept of this work was to modify a baby doll to create an unsettling experience. This has been based of the idea of ‘haunted dolls’ and the idea of demon possession taking over the body. I wanted to create something unsettling and kind of weird. 

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
